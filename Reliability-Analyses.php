                                        The fitness-for-service analysis methods discussed previously are deterministic approaches: these approaches using single point values
                                         to represent randomized attributes of a pipeline. Deterministic assessments have typically have several layers of conservatism that
                                          normally represent the worst-case scenarios, which oftentimes do not represent actual risk levels for the entire pipeline system.  
                                          Structural reliability analysis better accounts for variation in assessment variables and uncertainties in the assessment parameters 
                                          in more detail than a deterministic assessment, producing results that are more realistic.
