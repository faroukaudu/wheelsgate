                                <p> Most pipeline operators manage risks through compliance with regulatory requirements and/or application of guidance in industry Standards. Other operators perform 
                                    activities to mitigate risks where a failure occurs, or where it is recognized either through or experience that an asset could be at risk of been significantly impacted
                                     or fail. Sometimes these approaches may not occur in a structured manner, and the level of risks or required mitigation may not be well determined.  The objective of a
                                      risk assessment is to implement a structured process to identify credible threats to pipeline or facility assets, evaluate the likelihood that the identified 
                                    threats could potentially cause failure to the assets, and assess the consequence of failures in the event it fails. </p>

                                     an estimation of the risk, deciding whether or not it is tolerable and exercising appropriate control measures to reduce the risk to tolerable levels. But the key
                                      is how to decide what risk is and is not tolerable. </p>

                                    <p>Several industry standards provide guidance on the application of pipeline QRA either to existing pipeline assets or to proposed developments in the vicinity
                                         of high pressure pipelines.</p> <p>The Risk Assessment Working Group (RAWG) of the United Kingdom Onshore Pipeline Operators Association (UKOPA) has published 
                                         QRA guidance in two documents: IGEM/TD/2 for natural gas pipelines; and PD 8010-3 for other major accident hazard pipelines containing 
                                        flammable substances such as liquid petroleum gas (LPG).
                                        The Canadian Standard CSA Z6622015 Annex B also provide guidance on performing QRA. ASME B31.8S 
                                        also provide commentary on risk assessment approaches that could be implemented by an operator. </p> -->
