                                <p> Inspection plays an important role in controlling risks, but only if the inspections carried out are appropriate and are combined with a program to analyze the results
                                     and take remedial action when necessary.</p> -->
                                     <p>Inspections must provide information about a pipeline threat that leads to greater understanding of the probability of failure 
                                     due to the threat. There are two main ways in which this is achieved: by inspection to monitor the degradation of the pipeline condition or by inspecting to periodically
                                      confirm that the pipeline has not suffered a random event that has increased the failure probability. </p>

                                         current (EMAT) and geometry inspection technologies. We have also supported operators in selecting appropriate nondestructive examinations techniques 
                                         including the use of Magnetic Particle Inspections for surface defects, Phased Array UT, among many other inspection techniques.

                                    <p>WESL can develop processes for validating ILI tool performance from field inspection data within the guidelines in API 1163 standard.
                                         This process would involve matching indications from field investigations to corresponding features observed in the ILI to evaluate
                                          the inspection tool performance, as well as reviewing overall system and process results.
