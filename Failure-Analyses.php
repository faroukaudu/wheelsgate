                                <p> Hazardous liquid and gas pipelines are relatively safe compared to other forms of energy transportations. However, they do fail, and failure could cause fatalities,
                                     environmental damage and business losses. Pipeline could fail as a leak or a rupture. Causes of pipeline failures vary around the world, and from country to country.
                                      The leading causes have generally been due to corrosion and third-party damage. The gas standard ASME B31.8S identified Nine (9) categories of threats conditions
                                      that could potentially cause pipeline failure, namely: </p>

                                <p>These threats are also applicable to liquid pipelines, but liquid lines are typically more susceptible to fatigue failures compared to gas lines
                                     due to more aggressive pressure cycling. Failure could also be result from interaction between these threat conditions, causing failure in
                                      situations where a failure would normally not occur from the presence of individual threats. To mitigate or prevent the re-occurrence of future
                                       failures, it is important that operators conduct a comprehensive review and analysis to gain understanding of credible threats to their pipeline 
                                       assets.

                                    <p>WESL can perform independent reviews of failure investigation studies conducted by other consultancy companies for operators who want a second
                                         opinion on completed studies. Oftentimes such additional work may be needed to verify or validate findings from failure analysis studies, or 
                                         simply to critique an existing study. This would assist operators in making informed decisions, particularly when uncertainties exist regarding
                                          conclusions and recommendations from previous studies, or new data become available that may necessitate an update and or could impact findings
                                           from previous studies.  </p>
