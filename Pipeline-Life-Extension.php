                                    are over 50 years old and have exceeded their original design life. </h4> -->

                                <p> Extending the life of a pipeline beyond its original design life could be a result of unexpectedly high reserves from an oil or gas field, increased potential
                                     from new satellite fields, or availability of new technology for enhanced recovery of oil and gas from old wells. Sometimes it could occur because of operating
                                     conditions or presence of time-dependent damage mechanism (such as corrosion or fatigue) on a pipeline being more aggressive than anticipated, leading to premature
                                      degradation of the line.</p>
                                <p> Consequently, a plan or strategy may be required to extend the life of the pipeline to match the remaining life of the production field. The key to extending the life
                                     is to estimate the rate of degradation from the damage mechanism and using this to determine the remaining life. 
                                    Remedial actions can then be implemented focusing on assets which cannot be mitigated by existing integrity management programs. </p>

                            <p>Operating pipelines (and energy assets) beyond their original design life is now commonplace in the oil and gas industry and is recognized in some codes
                                         and regulations. Pipeline life extension has typically relied on good integrity management, which can be summarized as the identification and control of threats or hazards that could cause degradation and failure. Industry codes such as ISO TS-12747
                                         and NORSOK Y-002 which provide guidance for formally extending the design life of pipeline systems. Formal life extension
                                          requires skills in integrity management and an understanding of design.  </p>
