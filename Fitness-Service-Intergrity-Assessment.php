                                <P>Hazardous liquid and gas pipelines are relatively safe compared to other forms of energy transportations systems. However, they do fail,
                                     and failure could cause fatalities, environmental damage and business losses.
                                     Pipeline could fail as a leak or a rupture. Causes of pipeline failures vary around the world, and from country to country. In order to prevent pipeline failure it is 
                                     important that operators conduct studies to assess the condition of their pipeline assets,
                                     including those with identified or known flaws or defects to ascertain their continued fitness for service (FFS).</P>
                                <P>The fitness-for-service of a pipeline containing a defect or threat condition may be determined by a variety of methods ranging from previous relevant experience, to model
                                     testing, to ‘engineering critical assessments’ (ECAs), where a defect is appraised analytically, taking into account applied loadings and its environment.</P>
                                <P>Procedures in standards such as BS 7910, API 579/ASME FFS-1, ASME B31G, DNV-OS-F10, and integrity management standards such as API 1176, API 1160, can be used to evaluate the integrity 
                                    of critical pressure components and welded structures against different failure modes, using proven engineering approaches. Industry documents such the Pipeline Defect Assessment Manual
                                     (PDAM) also provide guidance on best practices available in the industry for assessing the wide variety of defects or threat conditions that may be identified in pipelines. </P>
                            

                                     <p><strong>ASME B31.8S identified Nine (9) categories of threats conditions that could potentially cause pipeline failure, namely:</stong>

                                    <p>Two forms of interactions are generally recognized in pipeline integrity evaluations. One form of interaction occurs at the 
                                    feature level, while the other at the integrity threat level.</p>
